<h1>Resources</h1>
<p>
 

These are some of my favorite resources so far. I'm sure this list will grow and change over time. Feel free to share some of your favorite resources via our contact page!</p>

<h1>
End-of-Life Planning
</h1>
 
<h3>
National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization</h3>
<p>

This is one of the very best comprehensive websites I've found so far. The resources are extensive and easy to navigate including downloadable Advance Care Directives by State. "... a program of the National Hospice and Palliative Care Organization, provides free resources to help people make decisions about end-of-life care and services before a crisis."</p>

<h3>The Order of the Good Death</h3>
<p>
Founded by an alternative funeral director, this website comprehensively addresses all aspects of death and dying with phenomenal resources. “The members of the Order believe there is a revolution afoot in the way our society handles death…We invite you to join the Order and make the changes that will allow you, your family, and your culture die better.”</p>
