    <h1>Home Funerals & Natural Burials</h1>
    <p>The <a href='https://www.homefuneralalliance.org/'>National Home Funeral Alliance (NHFA)</a> is an exceptional international organization providing excellent resources, information and support, including an emergency <a href='https://www.homefuneralalliance.org/contact.html'>hotline</a> and a <a href='https://www.homefuneralalliance.org/state-requirements.html'>Quick Guide to Home Funerals by State</a>. They also have a wonderful new podcast, A Path Home, with a recent episode featuring my dear friend and colleague, Rev. Kate Adamson, interfaith minister.
    </p><br>
    <p>
    Kate and I have formed a new volunteer organization, 
    <a href='https://www.facebook.com/thresholdva/?modal=admin_todo_tour'>
    Threshold Services of Central Virginia</a> to provide education, advocacy, vigil sitting and set up, after-death body care and preparations, informational and logistical support for all aspects of home funerals and natural burials, including care and care coordination and crafting meaningful, tailored ceremonies, rituals and rites of passage. Our team of volunteers provide care or support loved ones in providing care to suit each familyâ€™s needs. We are devoted to holistic care at end-of-life and after death. We work closely with the NHFA to train our volunteers with their excellent <a href='https://www.homefuneralalliance.org/home-funeral-books.html'>educational resources</a> and are joining the wave of
    support for their "20 in 2020!" goal - 20 new Threshold / Community Care Groups in 2020!
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
    Monthly volunteer meetings and trainings followed by open-to-the-public Death Salons for discussing end-of-life and after-death matters are just a few of the projects underway. We also have upcoming events and playshops such as The Death Box Initiative, 
    The Advance Care Directive Party - fill it out, sign it and celebrate it, and so much more! <a href='https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1HttxyrpFnfBHI4fsqwQ1aNpJwjwyDHYMHyrO9CsrMtw/prefill'>
    Join our mailing list</a> and stay in the loop about upcoming events and articles of interest. You can follow us on Facebook and Instagram.
