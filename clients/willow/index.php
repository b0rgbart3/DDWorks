            <h1>Welcome</h1>
            <h2>Welcome to my end-of-life care and support network.</h2>
            <p>I am glad you&#39;re here and that you are choosing to explore exceptional end-of-life care. Whether you or a loved one is facing death or making decisions now for a time when you are, I am here for you every step of the way with informational <a href='resources.php'>Resources</a> and a wide variety of caregiving services listed below that we can custom tailor together to suit your evolving needs.
            </p>
            <h2>Introductions</h2>
            <p>Our first in-person meeting is always free of charge and obligation. I will conduct a short interview where the client resides to learn about your needs and desires, to tell you about my services and to answer any questions you have. This is intimate work by its nature. I am committed to my clientâ€™s dignity, ensuring they are as empowered as possible in making decisions concerning their care and that their wishes are upheld. I cultivate open communication, ease and grace with clients, their loved ones and caregivers. I endeavor to make sure everyone feels good, informed and empowered about care arrangements and that we agree on terms, hours and beginning strategies.
            </p>
            <h2>My Rates</h2>
            <p>I provide a sliding scale in a concerted effort to be as financially accessible as possible. You decide where you slide. Any money you pay above the bottom end of the sliding scale goes into a scholarship fund for those who require financial assistance. 
                If you or your loved ones have families, religious, social or other community groups and connections, many of my clients have had great success and some ease in sharing fundraising requests with these groups through using crowd funding platforms such as PayPal, GoFundMe and many more. I also accept some barter options. If you'd like more information, please <a href='contact.php'>contact me</a>.
            </p>
            <p>Hourly Rate: $25-$20/hour, sliding scale</p>
            <p>
                Part-time Weekly Rate includes 25 hours plus up to 3 hours of on-call services: $750-$600, sliding scale</p>
