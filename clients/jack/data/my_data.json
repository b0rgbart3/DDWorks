On one Skirt Sunday we were sashaying through Buena Vista Park and came across a graffito that read: KILL FAGS. Someone had a gold marker in the pocket of their skirt. They whipped out that marker and changed the ‘L’s to ‘S’s. So now it read: KISS FAGS. Then we put on lipstick and kissed the wall around the letters. That experience inspired me to do this piece.",
