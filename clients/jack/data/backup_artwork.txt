Years ago, there used to be this event in San Francisco called Skirt Sunday. A bunch of us radical Faeries would meet at someone’s house in the Haight, put on skirts and walk to the Castro to parade around, back when wearing a skirt in the Castro was transgressive. On one Skirt Sunday we were sashaying through Buena Vista Park and came across a graffito that read: KILL FAGS. Someone had a gold marker in the pocket of their skirt. They whipped out that marker and changed the ‘L’s to ‘S’s. So now it read: KISS FAGS. Then we put on lipstick and kissed the wall around the letters. That experience inspired me to do this piece. | 13W.jpg & 13WA.jpg
